# NuwaEngine

NuwaEngine is an experimental 3D rendering engine built on top of Apple Metal for macOS and iOS. This project aims to provide a robust foundation for an AI-driven game engine that supports various advanced features such as spatial handling, physics, audio, and animation.

## Current Milestone

The current milestone involves setting up the core rendering pipeline and scene management system.

### Completed
- Initial project structure and file organization.
- Core components:
  - `RenderSystem`: Sets up Metal rendering pipeline.
  - `Scene`: Manages entities in the 3D scene.
  - `Entity` and `SceneNode`: Represent and organize objects in the scene.
- Basic Metal setup to render a blank screen.

## Future Milestones

1. **Rendering Basic Geometry**: Display basic shapes like triangles and squares.
2. **Add Spatial Engine**: Support for scalable space handling (mm, cm, m, km).
3. **Integrate Physics Engine**: Basic physics for rigid bodies and collisions.
4. **Add Audio System**: Spatial and background audio handling.
5. **Implement Animation System**: Keyframe and procedural animations.

## How to Run

To run the project, you need:
- **Xcode 12** or later
- **macOS 11** or later

Open the project in Xcode and run it on an iOS simulator or macOS. At this stage, the application will display a black screen, indicating the Metal pipeline is set up and ready for future development.
